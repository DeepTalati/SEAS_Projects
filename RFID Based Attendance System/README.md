This project was developed for the course ESD in sem 4.

We try to make the attendance system easy, automated, and quick, keeping
in mind the price of the end product as well. If there are no entities in the
classroom, then the system should automatically turn everything off.
Provide a better, effortless, faster alternative for marking students’
presence, and while it may not be perfect, it should be economic
